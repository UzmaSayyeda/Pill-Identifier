Bacteria can play a role, too. A big trigger for the onset of acne is puberty. Better nutrition and living standards have seen the age of puberty, especially in girls, decrease significantly over the past 40 years. It is now not uncommon for girls as young as 7 to develop acne. Acne is also affecting more adults later in life and doctors are not sure why. A growing number of women have acne in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond. What Causes Acne? Our body constantly makes and sheds skin. Normally, dead skin cells rise to the surface of the pore and just flake off our body. At puberty, hormones trigger the production of sebum - an oily substance that helps moisturize our skin. Sebum sticks dead skin cells together, increasing their chances of becoming trapped inside a pore. Clogged pores become blackheads, whiteheads or pimples. If bacteria are also present, redness and swelling can occur resulting in the progression of the pimple into a cyst or nodule. Who is More at Risk of Acne? Unfortunately, some people suffer from acne worse than others. Bad acne tends to run in families - your mother, father, aunt or uncle probably had severe breakouts when they were a teenager. Some people also have naturally higher hormone levels and make more sebum, so their skin pores are always clogging up. If you live in an area that gets very humid or have a job which exposes you to moist heat (such as in a food kitchen) or grease or tar (a mechanic or road worker) then you are more likely to get acne. Chin straps, headbands, and even hair products applied too close to the skin can precipitate a break out as several different medicines - most notably prednisone, phenytoin, and certain hormonal contraceptives that are high in androgens (for example, Microgestin 1.5/30 and the Depo-Provera shot). What are the Symptoms of Acne? Acne may appear on the face, forehead, chest, upper back or shoulders. The symptoms and severity of acne vary from person to person but may include: Whiteheads Blackheads Papules (small, red, tender bumps) Pimples (papules with pus at their tips) Nodules (large solid painful lumps beneath the skin surface Cystic lesions (painful pus-filled lumps beneath the skinÂ’s surface). How is Acne Diagnosed? If your acne makes you shy or embarrassed, if you have a lot of acne, cysts or nodules on your face or back, or if over the counter products do not seem to work, see your doctor or a dermatologist as soon as you can. They can prescribe stronger topical or oral treatments that are much more effective than products you can buy at a drug store. Your doctor will look at your skin and ask about the history of your acne. It is a myth that you have to let acne run its course. Treatment helps prevent dark spots and permanent scars from forming as the acne clears. How is Acne Treated? The most important thing you can do to reduce the chance of breakouts is to take good care of your skin. This doesn't mean scrubbing it raw several times a day with soap. It means gently cleansing it with a mild soap-free wash twice a day, every day. If you play a lot of sport or work in a greasy or humid environment, cleanse your skin as soon as you finish training or right after work. Be gentle. You aim to cleanse away excess sebum and dead skin cells so they don't clog up your pores - not to irritate your skin even further. The first step to clear skin is clean skin. Look for a cleanser that is soap-free and does not contain any harsh detergents such as sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates, which can cause redness, irritation, and inflammation. Avoid pore-clogging ingredients as well, such as algae extract, carrageenan, lanolin, myristyl myristate, octyl palmitate, octyl stearate-5, and oleth-3. Anti-acne ingredients work by removing dead skin cells, unclogging pores, or reducing bacteria numbers on the skin. Acne treatments usually contain one of the following ingredients (some of which are only available on prescription): Benzoyl peroxide Salicyclic acid Resorcinol Azelaic acid Dapsone gel Retinoids and retinoid-like creams, gels, and lotions Topical antibiotics Oral antibiotics (eg, tetracyclines, Combined oral contraceptives Oral isotretinoin Spironolactone Lasers and photodynamic therapy Chemical peels Steroid injections. If you have severe acne you need to be very proactive with skin cleansing and using acne treatment. Seeing a dermatologist early on for prescription products lessens the chances of being left with permanent scars. How Can I Prevent Acne? Gently wash your face twice a day and after sweating. Shampoo your hair regularly. Do not pick or squeeze your acne; this increases the risk of scars. Keep your hands off your face. Wash your hands before applying make-up. Be careful what you put on your face, and avoid ingredients that promote acne. Stay out of the sun and off tanning beds; excess tanning can damage your skin. See a dermatologist if you feel shy or products don't work."

Bacteria can play a role, too. A big trigger for the onset of acne is puberty. Better nutrition and living standards have seen the age of puberty, especially in girls, decrease significantly over the past 40 years. It is now not uncommon for girls as young as 7 to develop acne. Acne is also affecting more adults later in life and doctors are not sure why. A growing number of women have acne in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond. What Causes Acne? Our body constantly makes and sheds skin. Normally, dead skin cells rise to the surface of the pore and just flake off our body. At puberty, hormones trigger the production of sebum - an oily substance that helps moisturize our skin. Sebum sticks dead skin cells together, increasing their chances of becoming trapped inside a pore. Clogged pores become blackheads, whiteheads or pimples. If bacteria are also present, redness and swelling can occur resulting in the progression of the pimple into a cyst or nodule. Who is More at Risk of Acne? Unfortunately, some people suffer from acne worse than others. Bad acne tends to run in families - your mother, father, aunt or uncle probably had severe breakouts when they were a teenager. Some people also have naturally higher hormone levels and make more sebum, so their skin pores are always clogging up. If you live in an area that gets very humid or have a job which exposes you to moist heat (such as in a food kitchen) or grease or tar (a mechanic or road worker) then you are more likely to get acne. Chin straps, headbands, and even hair products applied too close to the skin can precipitate a break out as several different medicines - most notably prednisone, phenytoin, and certain hormonal contraceptives that are high in androgens (for example, Microgestin 1.5/30 and the Depo-Provera shot). What are the Symptoms of Acne? Acne may appear on the face, forehead, chest, upper back or shoulders. The symptoms and severity of acne vary from person to person but may include: Whiteheads Blackheads Papules (small, red, tender bumps) Pimples (papules with pus at their tips) Nodules (large solid painful lumps beneath the skin surface Cystic lesions (painful pus-filled lumps beneath the skinÂ’s surface). How is Acne Diagnosed? If your acne makes you shy or embarrassed, if you have a lot of acne, cysts or nodules on your face or back, or if over the counter products do not seem to work, see your doctor or a dermatologist as soon as you can. They can prescribe stronger topical or oral treatments that are much more effective than products you can buy at a drug store. Your doctor will look at your skin and ask about the history of your acne. It is a myth that you have to let acne run its course. Treatment helps prevent dark spots and permanent scars from forming as the acne clears. How is Acne Treated? The most important thing you can do to reduce the chance of breakouts is to take good care of your skin. This doesn't mean scrubbing it raw several times a day with soap. It means gently cleansing it with a mild soap-free wash twice a day, every day. If you play a lot of sport or work in a greasy or humid environment, cleanse your skin as soon as you finish training or right after work. Be gentle. You aim to cleanse away excess sebum and dead skin cells so they don't clog up your pores - not to irritate your skin even further. The first step to clear skin is clean skin.

If you live in an area that gets very humid or have a job which exposes you to moist heat (such as in a food kitchen) or grease or tar (a mechanic or road worker) then you are more likely to get acne. Chin straps, headbands, and even hair products applied too close to the skin can precipitate a break out as several different medicines - most notably prednisone, phenytoin, and certain hormonal contraceptives that are high in androgens (for example, Microgestin 1.5/30 and the Depo-Provera shot). What are the Symptoms of Acne? Acne may appear on the face, forehead, chest, upper back or shoulders. The symptoms and severity of acne vary from person to person but may include: Whiteheads Blackheads Papules (small, red, tender bumps) Pimples (papules with pus at their tips) Nodules (large solid painful lumps beneath the skin surface Cystic lesions (painful pus-filled lumps beneath the skinÂ’s surface). How is Acne Diagnosed? If your acne makes you shy or embarrassed, if you have a lot of acne, cysts or nodules on your face or back, or if over the counter products do not seem to work, see your doctor or a dermatologist as soon as you can. They can prescribe stronger topical or oral treatments that are much more effective than products you can buy at a drug store. Your doctor will look at your skin and ask about the history of your acne. It is a myth that you have to let acne run its course. Treatment helps prevent dark spots and permanent scars from forming as the acne clears. How is Acne Treated? The most important thing you can do to reduce the chance of breakouts is to take good care of your skin. This doesn't mean scrubbing it raw several times a day with soap. It means gently cleansing it with a mild soap-free wash twice a day, every day. If you play a lot of sport or work in a greasy or humid environment, cleanse your skin as soon as you finish training or right after work. Be gentle. You aim to cleanse away excess sebum and dead skin cells so they don't clog up your pores - not to irritate your skin even further. The first step to clear skin is clean skin. Look for a cleanser that is soap-free and does not contain any harsh detergents such as sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates, which can cause redness, irritation, and inflammation. Avoid pore-clogging ingredients as well, such as algae extract, carrageenan, lanolin, myristyl myristate, octyl palmitate, octyl stearate-5, and oleth-3. Anti-acne ingredients work by removing dead skin cells, unclogging pores, or reducing bacteria numbers on the skin. Acne treatments usually contain one of the following ingredients (some of which are only available on prescription): Benzoyl peroxide Salicyclic acid Resorcinol Azelaic acid Dapsone gel Retinoids and retinoid-like creams, gels, and lotions Topical antibiotics Oral antibiotics (eg, tetracyclines, Combined oral contraceptives Oral isotretinoin Spironolactone Lasers and photodynamic therapy Chemical peels Steroid injections. If you have severe acne you need to be very proactive with skin cleansing and using acne treatment. Seeing a dermatologist early on for prescription products lessens the chances of being left with permanent scars. How Can I Prevent Acne? Gently wash your face twice a day and after sweating. Shampoo your hair regularly. Do not pick or squeeze your acne; this increases the risk of scars. Keep your hands off your face. Wash your hands before applying make-up. Be careful what you put on your face, and avoid ingredients that promote acne. Stay out of the sun and off tanning beds; excess tanning can damage your skin. See a dermatologist if you feel shy or products don't work."

Bacteria can play a role, too. A big trigger for the onset of acne is puberty. Better nutrition and living standards have seen the age of puberty, especially in girls, decrease significantly over the past 40 years. It is now not uncommon for girls as young as 7 to develop acne. Acne is also affecting more adults later in life and doctors are not sure why. A growing number of women have acne in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond. What Causes Acne? Our body constantly makes and sheds skin. Normally, dead skin cells rise to the surface of the pore and just flake off our body. At puberty, hormones trigger the production of sebum - an oily substance that helps moisturize our skin. Sebum sticks dead skin cells together, increasing their chances of becoming trapped inside a pore. Clogged pores become blackheads, whiteheads or pimples. If bacteria are also present, redness and swelling can occur resulting in the progression of the pimple into a cyst or nodule. Who is More at Risk of Acne?

Bacteria can play a role, too. A big trigger for the onset of acne is puberty. Better nutrition and living standards have seen the age of puberty, especially in girls, decrease significantly over the past 40 years. It is now not uncommon for girls as young as 7 to develop acne. Acne is also affecting more adults later in life and doctors are not sure why. A growing number of women have acne in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond. What Causes Acne? Our body constantly makes and sheds skin. Normally, dead skin cells rise to the surface of the pore and just flake off our body. At puberty, hormones trigger the production of sebum - an oily substance that helps moisturize our skin. Sebum sticks dead skin cells together, increasing their chances of becoming trapped inside a pore. Clogged pores become blackheads, whiteheads or pimples. If bacteria are also present, redness and swelling can occur resulting in the progression of the pimple into a cyst or nodule. Who is More at Risk of Acne? Unfortunately, some people suffer from acne worse than others. Bad acne tends to run in families - your mother, father, aunt or uncle probably had severe breakouts when they were a teenager. Some people also have naturally higher hormone levels and make more sebum, so their skin pores are always clogging up. If you live in an area that gets very humid or have a job which exposes you to moist heat (such as in a food kitchen) or grease or tar (a mechanic or road worker) then you are more likely to get acne. Chin straps, headbands, and even hair products applied too close to the skin can precipitate a break out as several different medicines - most notably prednisone, phenytoin, and certain hormonal contraceptives that are high in androgens (for example, Microgestin 1.5/30 and the Depo-Provera shot). What are the Symptoms of Acne? Acne may appear on the face, forehead, chest, upper back or shoulders. The symptoms and severity of acne vary from person to person but may include: Whiteheads Blackheads Papules (small, red, tender bumps) Pimples (papules with pus at their tips) Nodules (large solid painful lumps beneath the skin surface Cystic lesions (painful pus-filled lumps beneath the skinÂ’s surface). How is Acne Diagnosed? If your acne makes you shy or embarrassed, if you have a lot of acne, cysts or nodules on your face or back, or if over the counter products do not seem to work, see your doctor or a dermatologist as soon as you can. They can prescribe stronger topical or oral treatments that are much more effective than products you can buy at a drug store. Your doctor will look at your skin and ask about the history of your acne. It is a myth that you have to let acne run its course. Treatment helps prevent dark spots and permanent scars from forming as the acne clears. How is Acne Treated? The most important thing you can do to reduce the chance of breakouts is to take good care of your skin. This doesn't mean scrubbing it raw several times a day with soap. It means gently cleansing it with a mild soap-free wash twice a day, every day. If you play a lot of sport or work in a greasy or humid environment, cleanse your skin as soon as you finish training or right after work. Be gentle. You aim to cleanse away excess sebum and dead skin cells so they don't clog up your pores - not to irritate your skin even further. The first step to clear skin is clean skin. Look for a cleanser that is soap-free and does not contain any harsh detergents such as sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates, which can cause redness, irritation, and inflammation. Avoid pore-clogging ingredients as well, such as algae extract, carrageenan, lanolin, myristyl myristate, octyl palmitate, octyl stearate-5, and oleth-3. Anti-acne ingredients work by removing dead skin cells, unclogging pores, or reducing bacteria numbers on the skin. Acne treatments usually contain one of the following ingredients (some of which are only available on prescription): Benzoyl peroxide Salicyclic acid Resorcinol Azelaic acid Dapsone gel Retinoids and retinoid-like creams, gels, and lotions Topical antibiotics Oral antibiotics (eg, tetracyclines, Combined oral contraceptives Oral isotretinoin Spironolactone Lasers and photodynamic therapy Chemical peels Steroid injections. If you have severe acne you need to be very proactive with skin cleansing and using acne treatment. Seeing a dermatologist early on for prescription products lessens the chances of being left with permanent scars. How Can I Prevent Acne? Gently wash your face twice a day and after sweating. Shampoo your hair regularly. Do not pick or squeeze your acne; this increases the risk of scars. Keep your hands off your face. Wash your hands before applying make-up. Be careful what you put on your face, and avoid ingredients that promote acne. Stay out of the sun and off tanning beds; excess tanning can damage your skin.

There are three main subgroups of ADHD: Predominantly inattentive ADHD: inattention is the main characteristic, daydreaming is common Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive ADHD: hyperactivity and impulsiveness predominate Combined ADHD: all three behaviors (inattention, hyperactivity and impulsiveness) are present. What are the Symptoms of ADHD? Each person varies in the severity and frequency of their symptoms. Originally it was thought that ADHD was more common in boys; however, experts believe girls are more likely to present with inattentive characteristics and are more likely overlooked. ADHD occurs across all races and socioeconomic groups. Symptoms can be grouped depending on the predominant behavior. Examples of inattentive behavior include: Being easily distracted Daydreaming Disorganization Making silly mistakes Often late Short attention span. Examples of hyperactive behavior include: Constantly moving Fidgeting High energy levels Restlessness Trouble sitting still Trouble switching off/sleeping. Examples of impulsive behavior include: Acting without thinking Blurting out answers/secrets Interrupting Prone to accidents. Other symptoms that are common to people with ADHD include: Creativity High Intelligence Delayed social maturity Enthusiasm Sensitivity. What Causes ADHD? The causes of ADHD are not fully known, but research is actively ongoing. There does appear to be a link between a family history of ADHD (genetics) with over 25% of relatives of families with a child with ADHD who also had the condition. There is also an 82% chance that identical twins will both have ADHD if at least one of them has the condition compared to a 38% chance among fraternal twins. Other factors that have been identified as possibly contributing to ADHD include: Brain injury from a traumatic event (eg, stroke, head trauma, tumor) Exposure to lead after birth Low birth weight Fetal exposure to alcohol or cigarette smoke Herbicides Pesticides. There is no evidence that poor parenting, certain foods, sugar, or vaccinations cause ADHD. How is ADHD Diagnosed? If your child has symptoms suggestive of ADHD then talk with your doctor or pediatrician. They will talk with you, your child, and possibly your childÂ’s school and ask questions that focus on: Ability to control emotions Attentiveness Focus Home and school relationships Hyperactivity. They will ask if your family has any other family members with ADHD. Most cases of ADHD are diagnosed at age 7 or 8, but symptoms may begin sooner. ADHD usually still persists into adulthood; however, some people have learned how to manage their symptoms better so it may not be as noticeable. How is ADHD Treated?

It is a virus that attacks the immune system, specifically CD4 cells (also called T cells), which eventually reduces a personÂ’s ability to fight infection. HIV can progress to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) if left untreated. What Causes HIV? HIV is thought to have originally mutated from a virus that infects chimpanzees, called simian immunodeficiency virus. Research has indicated that the virus probably mutated into HIV, which is a version that could infect humans, as far back as the late 1800s when the chimpanzees were hunted for meat. HIV has been present in the United States since the mid to late 1970s. Who is at Risk for HIV? HIV can infect any person, no matter their age or gender or sexual preference. It is spread sexually, and by contact with infected blood, from mother to child during pregnancy, during childbirth, or through breast-feeding. People have a higher risk of contracting HIV if they: Have sex. Even condoms donÂ’t provide 100% protection against HIV and the virus can enter your body through mouth sores following oral sex. Have a blood transfusion, especially in certain countries overseas. The risk in America is very small as hospitals and blood banks now screen the blood supply for HIV antibodies. Share needles. IV drug paraphernalia (needles and syringes) may be contaminated with HIV or other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis Are pregnant and are HIV positive. Treatment for HIV during pregnancy significantly lowers the risk of passing on the infection to their babies Have a sexually transmitted infection (STI). STIs act as a gateway to HIV infection because they compromise tissues or break the skin barrier in your genital area Are an uncircumcised man. Research has shown this increases the transmission of HIV. HIV cannot be spread through hugging, kissing, dancing or shaking hands with someone who has the infection. It is also not spread through insect bites, air, or water. What are the Symptoms of HIV? The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary, depending on the phase of infection. When you first acquire HIV it may take a month or two before symptoms show and these may last a week or two. Even then these may easily be confused with another type of viral illness, such as the flu, or so mild as not to be noticed initially. Symptoms of an initial acute HIV infection may include: Fever Headache Muscle aches and joint pain Painful mouth sores Rash Sore throat Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck. The infection is easily spread during this stage. The next stage of HIV infection is called clinical latent infection . Generally, there are few signs or symptoms during this stage which may last approximately 10 years, although some people may develop persistent swelling of the lymph nodes or more severe disease sooner. HIV persists in the bloodstream and white blood cells. Infections start to become more common as the virus continues to multiply and destroy your immune cells. Signs and symptoms of symptomatic HIV infection include: Fever Fatigue Diarrhea Weight loss Yeast infection (eg, oral thrush) Shingles Swollen lymph nodes. If left untreated, HIV usually progresses to AIDS (also known as stage 3 HIV ) in about 10 years, although some people never develop AIDS despite never having treatment. A person is said to have AIDS when their CD4 count (a protein found on the surface of immune cells) falls below 200 (or the CD4 percentage falls below 14%) or when they develop certain opportunistic infections or cancers. How is HIV Treated? Although there is no cure for HIV, medications can dramatically slow the progression of the disease and people can live a relatively infection-free life. Few people die of AIDS these days thanks to effective treatments. Medications used to treat HIV are called antiretrovirals (also referred to as ART or ARV). Most people with HIV take combination ART every day. ART also reduces the risk of HIV transmission. Approved ARV treatments are grouped into seven drug classes as follows: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) Protease inhibitors (PIs) Fusion inhibitors CCR5 antagonists Post-attachment inhibitors Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs)."

Substances that cause allergies are called allergens or Â“triggersÂ”. What Causes Allergies? When you have allergies, your immune system mistakes normally harmless substances for dangerous invaders and produces antibodies to fight them. These antibodies release chemicals, such as histamine, that cause allergy symptoms. The most common allergens are: Animal fur or hair (such as that from cats, dogs, horses, or rabbits) Dust mites Food, especially cowÂ’s milk, eggs, peanuts, seafood, soy, tree nuts (almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews) and wheat Insect stings Latex Medicines Mould Pollen. An allergen for one person may not cause any problems in another person. There is a link between allergy and asthma. What are the Symptoms of Allergies? Reactions to the same allergen vary among individuals and depend on how the allergen entered the body (for example, being bitten by a mosquito causes a localized reaction on the skin whereas exposure to pollen may cause a tickly throat and itchy eyes). Symptoms may include: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting (food allergies) Areas of swelling and redness where a person has been stung or bitten (for insect bites/stings) Cough, chest tightness, wheezing or shortness of breath Itching of the nose, eyes or roof of the mouth A skin rash or hives, usually accompanied by body-wide itching Runny, stuffy nose Sneezing Swelling of the lips, tongue, face, or throat Tingling of the mouth Watery, red or swollen eyes (conjunctivitis) Wheezing. Some types of allergies can trigger a severe reaction known as anaphylaxis. Symptoms of anaphylaxis include: Loss of consciousness A drop in blood pressure Severe shortness of breath Skin rash Lightheadedness A rapid, weak pulse Nausea and vomiting. When Should I See a Doctor for my Allergies? Many allergies can be effectively treated with over-the-counter medications. See your doctor if you have persistent allergies that are interfering with your day to day life if you have severe reactions, or over the counter, remedies are not effective. People who develop anaphylaxis should always carry an epinephrine auto-injector 24 hours a day and know how to use it. People should also visit the emergency department after using the auto-injector to ensure symptoms don't return when the effects of the injection wear off. How Are Allergies Treated? Treatment depends on what is the most troublesome or predominant symptom. Treatments may include: Antihistamines (oral, nasal, topical) Corticosteroids (oral, nasal, topical) Decongestants (oral, nasal) Saline nasal rinses Immunotherapy. People with known allergies should try and avoid known triggers and wear a medical alert bracelet (or necklace) that lets others know that you have a serious allergy in case you have a reaction and you're unable to communicate."

However, if a person feels disproportionate levels of anxiety or it is present almost continuously, it might be diagnosed as an anxiety disorder. What Causes Anxiety? Anxiety is part of our survival response and is the way our body responds to potentially harmful or worrying triggers. Strong emotions or fear cause a surge of epinephrine (also called adrenaline) from our adrenal glands.

Other anxiety disorders include panic disorder, phobias, selective mutism, social anxiety disorder, and separation anxiety disorder. How is Anxiety or an Anxiety Disorder Treated?

This increases our heartbeat, increases our sensitivity to our surroundings, and prepares us for physical confrontation or to flee if we perceive any threats to our safety. This is often called the fight or flight response. Anxieties today mostly revolve around family, friends, health, money, or work. People more at risk of anxiety disorders include those: With relationship problems Whose jobs involve long hours, high workloads, little support, or danger With family members with anxiety disorders With medical conditions that result in significant lifestyle adjustments, pain, or restricted movement Who have experienced stressful or traumatic events Withdrawing from alcohol, opioids, or other substances. What are the Symptoms of an Anxiety Disorder? Symptoms of an anxiety disorder are usually out of proportion to the original trigger or stressor. If these are accompanied by significant physical symptoms such as increased sweating or increased blood pressure then a person is more likely to have an anxiety disorder rather than stimulus-appropriate anxiety. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic, ongoing condition with excessive worry over normal life events, whether minor or major. These feelings are usually out of proportion to the trouble that you may encounter in your everyday life. With GAD, feelings come on gradually and are present each day, not in one individual attack, and last for months, even years. Worry may be so excessive that it interferes with your daily life. GAD may also be accompanied by depression and substance abuse disorders. Symptoms of GAD include: Excessive and uncontrollable worry Increased irritability Difficulty concentrating Restlessness or a feeling of being on edge Rapid breathing Excessive perspiration and sweating Trembling, quivering Fatigue Trouble concentrating Headaches, stomach upset Avoidance of circumstances that might trigger severe anxiety Sleep difficulties. Other anxiety disorders include panic disorder, phobias, selective mutism, social anxiety disorder, and separation anxiety disorder. How is Anxiety or an Anxiety Disorder Treated? Treatment depends on the severity and type of anxiety disorder and if it is interfering with everyday life. Treatments may include: Stress management Relaxation techniques Mental imagery (replacing negative thoughts with positive ones) Cognitive Behavioral therapy Counseling Support Exercise Medications."

People with bipolar disorder fluctuate from feeling down and depressed to feeling super-charged or manic. The disorder used to be called manic depression or manic-depressive illness. However, nowadays, several types of bipolar disorder are recognized: bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymic disorder, mixed features, and rapid-cycling disorder. What are the Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? Symptoms vary among people with bipolar disorder, depending on what type of bipolar disorder they have. All have slightly different symptoms. Symptoms reflect mood opposites and may include: Periods of high or irritable mood High energy levels Scattered and unproductive activity sometimes with painful or embarrassing consequences Little, if any, need for sleep Thinking that is out of step with reality Psychotic symptoms, such as false beliefs (delusions) or false perceptions (hallucinations) Very low mood Deep depression Self-loathing Feelings of hopelessness or despair Refusal to get out of bed. Some people only develop milder symptoms of mania without psychotic symptoms. This is called hypomania. People who donÂ’t have full blown episodes of mania are more likely to have bipolar II disorder. These mood swings are much more severe than the normal ups and downs most people go through. In between mood swings, most people with bipolar disorder can lead relatively normal lives. The time spent in each mood state (ie, mania or depression) varies depending on the type of bipolar disorder but can range from days to months. The severity of the mood state can also vary significantly, with some people only ever experiencing mild symptoms. What Causes Bipolar Disorder? Although the exact cause is unknown, there does seem to be a genetic link, and you are more likely to get bipolar disorder if you have another family member with the condition. Symptoms are often triggered by a stressful situation or circumstance. This may take the form of a relationship breakdown; physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; money problems; or the death of a close family member or loved one. Symptoms are thought to be due to changes in the balance of some neurotransmitters in the brain, specifically noradrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine. It can be hard to recognize bipolar disorder initially. During a manic phase, a person with bipolar disorder may be incredibly fun to be around. However, as the condition progresses, these manic episodes become more extreme. Some people with bipolar disorder only experience slight mania and are mainly depressed. Misdiagnosis as depression is common. If an antidepressant is prescribed without a mood stabilizer, it will often catapult the person into a full-on manic state. Recognizing bipolar illness is important for treatment, as mood stabilizing agents are the best type of medication. How is Bipolar Disorder Treated? Bipolar disorder can be treated. For best results, medication needs to be combined with therapy sessions and the instigation of good routines. The most effective treatment for bipolar disorder is a mood stabilizing agent. These medications even out the troughs and the peaks of mood swings to keep you on a more even keel. Other treatments may include antipsychotics or antidepressants. Medications should be combined with nonpharmacological treatments, such as: Cognitive-behavioral therapy: This looks into any negative thought patterns you may have and challenges them in order to change your behavior. Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy: This aims to improve disruptions to your biological or social rhythms (such as sleep disturbances and relationship issues).

People with bipolar disorder fluctuate from feeling down and depressed to feeling super-charged or manic. The disorder used to be called manic depression or manic-depressive illness. However, nowadays, several types of bipolar disorder are recognized: bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymic disorder, mixed features, and rapid-cycling disorder. What are the Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? Symptoms vary among people with bipolar disorder, depending on what type of bipolar disorder they have. All have slightly different symptoms. Symptoms reflect mood opposites and may include: Periods of high or irritable mood High energy levels Scattered and unproductive activity sometimes with painful or embarrassing consequences Little, if any, need for sleep Thinking that is out of step with reality Psychotic symptoms, such as false beliefs (delusions) or false perceptions (hallucinations) Very low mood Deep depression Self-loathing Feelings of hopelessness or despair Refusal to get out of bed. Some people only develop milder symptoms of mania without psychotic symptoms. This is called hypomania. People who donÂ’t have full blown episodes of mania are more likely to have bipolar II disorder. These mood swings are much more severe than the normal ups and downs most people go through. In between mood swings, most people with bipolar disorder can lead relatively normal lives. The time spent in each mood state (ie, mania or depression) varies depending on the type of bipolar disorder but can range from days to months. The severity of the mood state can also vary significantly, with some people only ever experiencing mild symptoms. What Causes Bipolar Disorder? Although the exact cause is unknown, there does seem to be a genetic link, and you are more likely to get bipolar disorder if you have another family member with the condition. Symptoms are often triggered by a stressful situation or circumstance. This may take the form of a relationship breakdown; physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; money problems; or the death of a close family member or loved one. Symptoms are thought to be due to changes in the balance of some neurotransmitters in the brain, specifically noradrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine. It can be hard to recognize bipolar disorder initially. During a manic phase, a person with bipolar disorder may be incredibly fun to be around. However, as the condition progresses, these manic episodes become more extreme. Some people with bipolar disorder only experience slight mania and are mainly depressed. Misdiagnosis as depression is common. If an antidepressant is prescribed without a mood stabilizer, it will often catapult the person into a full-on manic state. Recognizing bipolar illness is important for treatment, as mood stabilizing agents are the best type of medication. How is Bipolar Disorder Treated? Bipolar disorder can be treated. For best results, medication needs to be combined with therapy sessions and the instigation of good routines. The most effective treatment for bipolar disorder is a mood stabilizing agent. These medications even out the troughs and the peaks of mood swings to keep you on a more even keel. Other treatments may include antipsychotics or antidepressants. Medications should be combined with nonpharmacological treatments, such as: Cognitive-behavioral therapy: This looks into any negative thought patterns you may have and challenges them in order to change your behavior. Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy: This aims to improve disruptions to your biological or social rhythms (such as sleep disturbances and relationship issues).

People with bipolar disorder fluctuate from feeling down and depressed to feeling super-charged or manic. The disorder used to be called manic depression or manic-depressive illness. However, nowadays, several types of bipolar disorder are recognized: bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymic disorder, mixed features, and rapid-cycling disorder. What are the Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? Symptoms vary among people with bipolar disorder, depending on what type of bipolar disorder they have. All have slightly different symptoms. Symptoms reflect mood opposites and may include: Periods of high or irritable mood High energy levels Scattered and unproductive activity sometimes with painful or embarrassing consequences Little, if any, need for sleep Thinking that is out of step with reality Psychotic symptoms, such as false beliefs (delusions) or false perceptions (hallucinations) Very low mood Deep depression Self-loathing Feelings of hopelessness or despair Refusal to get out of bed. Some people only develop milder symptoms of mania without psychotic symptoms. This is called hypomania. People who donÂ’t have full blown episodes of mania are more likely to have bipolar II disorder. These mood swings are much more severe than the normal ups and downs most people go through. In between mood swings, most people with bipolar disorder can lead relatively normal lives. The time spent in each mood state (ie, mania or depression) varies depending on the type of bipolar disorder but can range from days to months. The severity of the mood state can also vary significantly, with some people only ever experiencing mild symptoms. What Causes Bipolar Disorder? Although the exact cause is unknown, there does seem to be a genetic link, and you are more likely to get bipolar disorder if you have another family member with the condition. Symptoms are often triggered by a stressful situation or circumstance. This may take the form of a relationship breakdown; physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; money problems; or the death of a close family member or loved one. Symptoms are thought to be due to changes in the balance of some neurotransmitters in the brain, specifically noradrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine. It can be hard to recognize bipolar disorder initially. During a manic phase, a person with bipolar disorder may be incredibly fun to be around. However, as the condition progresses, these manic episodes become more extreme. Some people with bipolar disorder only experience slight mania and are mainly depressed. Misdiagnosis as depression is common. If an antidepressant is prescribed without a mood stabilizer, it will often catapult the person into a full-on manic state. Recognizing bipolar illness is important for treatment, as mood stabilizing agents are the best type of medication. How is Bipolar Disorder Treated? Bipolar disorder can be treated. For best results, medication needs to be combined with therapy sessions and the instigation of good routines. The most effective treatment for bipolar disorder is a mood stabilizing agent. These medications even out the troughs and the peaks of mood swings to keep you on a more even keel. Other treatments may include antipsychotics or antidepressants. Medications should be combined with nonpharmacological treatments, such as: Cognitive-behavioral therapy: This looks into any negative thought patterns you may have and challenges them in order to change your behavior. Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy: This aims to improve disruptions to your biological or social rhythms (such as sleep disturbances and relationship issues).

It causes inflammation in the lining of your bronchial tubes - these are the tubes that carry air from your trachea (windpipe) into your lungs. Bronchitis is most often caused by viruses, usually the same ones that cause a cold or the flu, although sometimes bacteria are to blame. Some people are more prone to getting bronchitis than others. People at higher risk include those who: Smoke Have a weak immune system Have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Work around airborne irritants such as chemical fumes or dust Live in cities or areas with high amounts of air pollution Are not vaccinated against the flu (the flu can lead to bronchitis). Symptoms of Bronchitis Symptoms of bronchitis can vary from mild to severe but usually include: A nagging productive cough that persists for several days to weeks Increased mucus production from the lungs. This is thicker than normal and may be discolored (yellowish-grey, green, rarely blood-streaked) Fatigue Chest tightness or discomfort Shortness of breath. Bronchitis is not usually accompanied by a fever. If you have a fever, you may have pneumonia or the flu instead. Bronchitis can develop into pneumonia in some people. Bronchitis may be described as acute or chronic. Acute bronchitis usually follows a cold or the flu and symptoms usually get better within a week although you may be left with a cough that lingers for several weeks. If your cough lasts for at least three months and you get recurring bouts of bronchitis over a period of two years it is referred to as chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is often due to smoking and is one of the conditions included in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Diagnosis of Bronchitis See a doctor if your cough lasts more than three weeks, is accompanied by a fever, is blood-tinged, or associated with wheezing or shortness of breath. Your doctor will perform a physical exam and listen to your lungs as you breathe with a stethoscope. A chest X-ray, sputum tests, or pulmonary function tests may also be conducted to help with the diagnosis. Treatment of Bronchitis Bronchitis is most often caused by viruses, so antibiotics will not help treat the condition. Most cases of acute bronchitis get better by themselves without treatment within a couple of weeks. Cough medications may help with sleep at night and people with other conditions (such as asthma or COPD) may benefit from bronchodilators and corticosteroids to open up their airways and reduce inflammation. People with chronic bronchitis may benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation Â– this is where a respiratory therapist teaches you exercises to help you breathe more easily and increase your ability to partake in physical activity. Nonpharmacological treatments can also help you feel better, such as: Warm lemon and honey drinks Humidifiers Â– these produce warm moist air which loosens mucus in the airway allowing you to cough it up easier Wearing a mask or a buff over your mouth outside if you are exposed to cold air, smoke, fumes, or other pollutants."

M Puckey BPharm What is COVID-19 COVID-19 Vaccines Treatments Investigational Vaccines What is COVID-19? COVID-19 is the disease caused by an infection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, first identified in the city of Wuhan, in China's Hubei province in December 2019. COVID-19 was previously known as 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) respiratory disease before the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the official name as COVID-19 in February 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 virus belongs to the family of viruses called coronaviruses, which also includes the viruses that cause the common cold, and the viruses that cause more serious infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which was caused by SARS-CoV in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which was caused by MERS-CoV in 2012. Like the other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 virus primarily causes respiratory tract infections, and the severity of the COVID-19 disease can range from mild to fatal. For more information on COVID-19 Symptoms, Prevention and Risks COVID-19: Symptoms, Prevention and Risks Stay up to date on COVID-19 News COVID-19 News (Newsfeed from Drugs.com) FDA approved COVID-19 Vaccines Comirnaty (BNT162b2, COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) last updated September 14, 2022.

Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent has emergency use authorization for use in individuals 5 years of age and older as a single booster dose administered at least 2 months after either: -Completion of primary vaccination with any authorized or approved monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. -Or receipt of the most recent booster dose with any authorized or approved monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (monovalent) contains the same vaccine as Comirnaty. Under an EUA approval the original vaccine has the name Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (monovalent) and when it is used as a FDA approved medicine it has the brand name Comirnaty. Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) last updated September 14, 2022. Vaccine platform: mRNA vaccine There are two different types of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccines, the original Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine which is monovalent and Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent. Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (monovalent) contains one messenger RNA (mRNA) component of the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 and has emergency use authorization to prevent COVID-19 for: -Two-dose primary series for individuals 6 months of age and older. -Third primary series dose for individuals 6 months of age and older who have been determined to have certain kinds of immunocompromise. Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent contains two messenger RNA (mRNA) components of SARS-CoV-2 virus, one of the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 and the other one in common between the BA.4 and BA.5 lineages of the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent has emergency use authorization for use in individuals 6 years of age and older as a single booster dose when given at least 2 months after either: -Completion of primary vaccination with any authorized or approved monovalent COVID-19 vaccine, or -Receipt of the most recent booster dose with any authorized or approved monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (monovalent) contains the same vaccine as Spikevax. When the original Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is used as a FDA approved vaccine it has the brand name Spikevax , and when it is used under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) approval it has the name Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (monovalent). Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine (NVX-CoV2373, Nuvaxovid, Covovax) (last updated October 20, 2022) Vaccine platform: Protein Subunit Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted contains the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and Matrix-M adjuvant. Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted received Emergency Use Authorization to protect against COVID-19 for individuals 12 years and older for the primary series. It has EUA as a booster dose for 18 years and older. Primary series: Two-dose primary series given three weeks apart for individuals 12 years and older. Booster dose: for individuals 18 years of age and older, at least 6 months after completion of primary vaccination with an authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine: -for individuals that a FDA-authorized mRNA bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine is not accessible or clinically appropriate, and -for individuals 18 years of age and older who elect to receive the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted because they would otherwise not receive a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Janssen - Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine (Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, Ad26.COV2-S) Vaccine platform: Non-Replicating Viral Vector Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is composed of a recombinant, replication-incompetent human adenovirus type 26 vector that expresses the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antigen to elicit an immune response and protect against COVID-19. The FDA originally granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine on February 27, 2021 for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. On May 5, 2022, the FDA limited the use of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine to individuals 18 years of age and older for whom other authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccines are not accessible or clinically appropriate, or individuals who elect to receive the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine because they would otherwise not receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is given to patients who fit the criteria above, as a single-dose primary regime with a single booster dose which is given at least 2 months after other primary dose. Treatments Remdesivir ( Veklury ) The original FDA approval has now been expanded for treatment for COVID-19 patients who are 28 days of age and older, who weigh at least 3 kilograms (about 7 pounds). Patients must have a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral test, be hospitalized, or non hospitalized patients must have mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and be at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. Remdesivir is a SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide analog RNA polymerase inhibitor (an antiviral drug with broad-spectrum antiviral activity). Bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) is a recombinant, neutralizing human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Bamlanivimab is no longer authorized to be used as a monotherapy, to treat recently diagnosed COVID-19, after the FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) was revoked on April 16, 2021. A combination therapy consisting of bamlanivimab and etesevimab (see below) is now available. Bamlanivimab and etesevimab has two separate Emergency Use Authorizations, one for the treatment of COVID-19 and another for post-exposure prophylaxis. Baricitinib ( Olumiant ) was FDA approved on May 10, 2022, to treat COVID-19 in patients 18 years and older who are hospitalized and require supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Baricitinib has an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) received from the FDA on July 28, 2021 to treat COVID-19 in hospitalized pediatric patients 2 years to less than 18 years of age, who require supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or ECMO. Previously the EUA required that Baricitinib had to be used with remdesivir (Veklury), but this requirement has been revoked and it can now be used without remdesivir. Baricitinib is Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor Baricitinib is marketed under the brand name Olumiant and is also an FDA approved medicine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and adult patients with severe alopecia areata. Bebtelovimab has had the EUA revoked on November 30, 2022 because it is not expected to neutralize Omicron subvariants BQ.1 and BQ.1.1. Bebtelovimab is a monoclonal antibody that was used for the treatment of specific patients who have COVID-19. It binds to the spike protein of the virus that causes COVID-19 and works against the omicron variant and the BA.2 omicron subvariant. The FDA originally granted Emergency Use Authorisation on February 11, 2022 for mild to moderate COVID-19 patients, who are 12 years of age and older, weighing at least 40 kilograms (88 pounds). They must have a positive COVID-19 test, and be at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, and unable to use alternative COVID-19 treatment options that are approved or authorized by the FDA, as they are not accessible or clinically appropriate. Bebtelovimab is not currently authorized for emergency use in any U.S. region at this time. Casirivimab and Imdevimab ( REGEN-COV, Ronapreve ) is unlikely to be effective against the omicron COVID-19 variant. For this reason the EUA has been amended to state that it can only be used for patients who are infected with a COVID-19 variant that is susceptible to carsirivimab and imdevimab. It was originally granted Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA on November 21, 2020 for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in patients. They must be at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19 and must be 12 years or older and weigh at least 40kg. The EUA was expanded so that REGEN-COV could be used as post-exposure prophylaxis in patients who are at high risk of severe COVID-19. Bamlanivimab and Etesevimab is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies that work to block the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is unlikely to be effective against the omicron COVID-19 variant. For this reason the EUA has been amended to state that it can be used only for patients who are infected with a COVID-19 variant that is susceptible to Bamlanivimab and Etesevimab. It was originally authorized to be used for COVID-19 by an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on 9 February 2021. An amendment to the EUA means that Bamlanivimab and Etesevimab can be used by neonates, pediatric patients and adults. It can be used as treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in patients who have a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral test and are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. Another amendment to the EUA means it can also be used as post-exposure prophylaxis (prevention) for people who have close contact with an someone who infected with SARS-CoV-2, or who are at high risk of exposure to a SARS-CoV-2 infected individual in an institutional settings such as a nursing homes, prisons etc. It can only be used as post-exposure prophylaxis by people who are at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, and are not fully vaccinated, or who are not expected to develop an adequate immune response to a complete SARS-CoV-2 vaccination series. Evusheld (AZD7442, tixagevimab with cilgavimab) has been issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for pre-exposure prevention of COVID-19 in a specific group of patients. Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are long-acting monoclonal antibodies that block the virusÂ’ attachment and entry into human cells by binding to different but overlapping sites on the virusÂ’ spike protein. Evusheld can be used by patients who are 12 years and older and weigh at least 40 kg (approximately 88 pounds). Patients must not currently be infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus and not recently be exposed to the virus. They must also have a moderate to severely compromised immune system or be unable to be vaccinated against COVID-19 due to severe adverse reaction to available vaccines and/or the components of the vaccine. Evusheld may be effective for pre-exposure prevention of COVID-19 for six months and after this time a repeat dose may be given. Kineret (Anakinra ) is an interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist that works to reduce acute severe lung inflammation. Kineret received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on November 8, 2022 to treat COVID-19 in hospitalized adults with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen (low- or high-flow oxygen) who are at risk of progressing to severe respiratory failure and likely to have an elevated plasma soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR). Kineret is also FDA approved to treat severe rheumatoid arthritis in adults, neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) in newborn babies, and deficiency of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA) in adults and children. Molnupiravir (LagevrioÂ®, MK-4482) is Merck's oral antiviral capsule that is a potent ribonucleoside analog that inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. On December 23, 2021 the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for molnupiravir as a treatment of COVID-19 for patients 18 years and older, who are at risk developing severe illness, including hospitalization or death. Patients must have had positive SARS-CoV-2 viral test and they must also be unable to use alternative COVID-19 treatment options, due to being inaccessible or being clinically inappropriate. Molnupiravir should be started within 5 days of first COVID-19 symptoms. Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets, co-packaged) previously called PF-07321332: Nirmatrelvir is an oral SARS-CoV2-3CL protease inhibitor and ritonavir slows the metabolism of nirmatrelvir making nirmatrelvir more effective. On December 22, 2021 the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization for Paxlovid for the treatment of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Paxlovid can be taken by patients 12 years and older who weigh at least 40kg (88lb), who have had a positive Sars-CoV-2 test and are at a high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. Paxlovid should be started with 5 days of first COVID-19 symptoms. Paxlovid may be prescribed for an individual patient by physicians, advanced practice registered nurses, and physician assistants that are licensed or authorized under state law to prescribe drugs. It may also be prescribed for an individual patient by a state-licensed pharmacist under specific conditions. Tocilizumab ( Actemra ) was granted Emergency Use Authorization on June 24, 2021 for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients 2 years of age and older. They must be on a specified treatment regime in hospital. Actemra is FDA approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. Actemra is an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist. Investigational Treatments Bemcentinib: An AXL kinase inhibitor called bemcentinib has been fast-tracked in a UK Phase II clinical trial to study its effectiveness in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Bemcentinib has previously been studied in cancer patients and has been shown to be safe and well-tolerated. It has also been reported to exhibit potent antiviral activity in preclinical models against several enveloped viruses, including Ebola and Zika virus, and recent data have expanded this to include SARS-CoV-2. Bevacizumab: A VEGF inhibitor called bevacizumab (marketed under the brand name Avastin for certain types of cancer) being studied as a treatment for acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Early studies show an improvement of oxygenation and shortening of duration of oxygen-support, but more randomized controlled trials are warranted. Chloroquine phosphate: The older anti-malaria drug chloroquine was studied for effectiveness for COVID-19 but scientific data showed that chloroquine was unlikely to be effective for COVID-19 and also caused serious adverse effects. For these reasons on June 15, 2020 the FDA revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) that had allowed chloroquine phosphate to be used for covid-19 patients. Colchicine: An older anti-inflammatory drug called colchicine is being studied to prevent complications of COVID-19 in high risk patients. Colchicine has long been used in the treatment of gout. Convalescent Plasma: On 6 December, 2021, The World Health Organisation (WHO) updated the Therapeutics and COVID-19: living guidelines to recommend against the use of convalescent plasma for treatment of non-severe COVID-19 patients. It also recommended against using convalescent plasma for treatment of severe or critical COVID-19 patients, unless it is part of a clinical trial. On August 23, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for investigational convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19. Studies have been completed with varying results, including the clinical trial SIREN-C3PO (NCT04355767) which showed convalescent plasma did not prevent disease progression of COVID-19. Another clinical trial NCT04338360 for hospitalized COVID-19 patients who were not receiving mechanical ventilation showed convalescent plasma transfusion with higher antiÂ–SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels lowered the risk of death compared to patients given convalescent plasma with lower levels of antiÂ–SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels. Dexamethasone: Results of the RECOVERY clinical trial (NCT04381936) showed that the cheap and widely available steroid dexamethasone reduced the 28-day mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who were receiving respiratory support. The NIH COVID-19 treatment guideline lists dexamethasone as a treatment for hospitalized adult COVID-19 on oxygen support. The trial also showed that there was no benefit and in fact may possibly cause harm to COVID-19 patients who did not require oxygen. Favipiravir: (FabiFluÂ®) An antiviral drug called favipiravir which was reported February 17, 2020 to have received marketing approval in China for the treatment of influenza, was also approved for use in clinical trials as a treatment for novel coronavirus pneumonia. On March 31, 2020, Fujifilm announced the start of a Phase 3 clinical trial of Avigan (favipiravir) on COVID-19 patients in Japan. Avigan is approved in Japan for use as an antiviral in the treatment of influenza. On April 9, 2020 -- Fujifilm announced the start of a Phase 2 clinical trial of favipiravir in approximately 50 COVID-19 patients in the U.S. On June 19, 2020, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited announced the marketing approval of favipiravir (FabiFluÂ®) for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 patients in India. Fluvoxamine: The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant fluvoxamine may work to prevent serious illness in COVID-19 patients who aren't yet hospitalized according to a small study . The current National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 treatment guidelines report that there is still insufficient evidence either for or against the use of fluvoxamine for the treatment of COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin: The results of large, randomized controlled trials have failed to show a benefit using a combination of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine and the macrolide antibacterial drug azithromycin (Zithromax) to treat COVID-19. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends against the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate: Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical trials studied the effect of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19. The RECOVERY Trial (NCT04381936) was a large, randomized, controlled, open-label, platform trial comparing hydroxychloroquine treatment with usual standard care for COVID-19. The results indicated that patients treated with hydroxychloroquine did not have a lower level of deaths, and hydroxychloroquine did not provide other benefits in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The emergency use authorization (EUA) that had been issued by the US FDA in March 2020 to allow the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate for the treatment of COVID-19 in certain hospitalized patients, was revoked on June 15, 2020. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends against the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine was first approved by the FDA in 1995 under the brand name Plaquenil, and it is used in the treatment of patients with lupus and arthritis. Ivermectin: An anti-parasitic drug called ivermectin is currently being investigated as a treatment for coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus that causes COVID-19. The FDA has not approved ivermectin for use in treating or preventing COVID-19 in humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommend not to use ivermectin in patients with COVID-19, except in clinical trials. Lenzilumab is a GM-CSF (Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) neutralizing monoclonal antibody that has been studied to reduce the excessive inflammatory response that may occur in COVID-19. The phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial called LIVE-AIR showed that early use of lenzilumab improved the chance of survival without the need for mechanical ventilation. Patients included in the study were hospitalized with COVID-19, required supplemental oxygen but had not yet progressed to invasive mechanical ventilation. Leronlimab: A CCR5 antagonist called leronlimab has shown promise in calming the 'cytokine storm' in a small number of critically ill COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the New York area. Lopinavir and ritonavir: A drug combination of lopinavir with ritonavir has been studied as a treatment for COVID-19 in a number of large, randomized controlled trials, with the results showing a lack of clinical benefit. The Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial using lopinavir with ritonavir was discontinued after the data showed no decrease in mortality and similar lengths of hospital stay times. The NIH recommends against using lopinavir with ritonavir for hospitalized or non hospitalized patients. Methylprednisolone: A widely used glucocorticoid called methylprednisolone is being studied for safety and effectiveness in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methylprednisolone is used in severe COVID-10 for its anti-inflammatory effect as it reduces the systemic inflammatory response that leads to lung injury and multisystem organ dysfunction. The NIH COVID-19 treatment guidelines indicate methylprednisolone can be used if dexamethasone is unavailable. Clinical trial results comparing treatment with dexamethasone to methylprednisolone in hospitalized patients with severe SARS-CoV2 Pneumonia showed both statistically significantly reduced recovery time and the need for transfer to intensive care. MK-7110 (formerly CD24Fc): is a potentially first-in-class investigational recombinant fusion protein. In April 2021, Merck announced the discontinuation of the development of MK-7110 and instead focus its pandemic efforts on advancing molnupiravir and on producing Johnson & JohnsonÂ’s COVID-19 vaccine. MK-7110 works by modulating the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2, principally by targeting a novel immune pathway checkpoint. Interim results from a Phase 3 study showed a greater than 50 percent reduction in the risk of death or respiratory failure in patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19. Peginterferon Lambda: Clinical trials using Peginterferon Lambda to treat COVID-19 have been completed with varying results. In one trial on non hospitalized COVID-19 patients Peginterferon Lambda increased the proportion of patients with viral clearance by day 7, which could potentially prevent clinical deterioration. In another trial non hospitalized patients with uncomplicated COVID-19 did not have a significant reduction time in viral clearance or resolution of symptoms when compared with placebo. Zyesami ( RLF-100 : aviptadil ) is a formulation of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) which binds to alveolar type 2 cells in the lungs inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines. Zyesami is currently enrolling patients for Phase 3 trials for hospitalized patients with life-threatening cases of COVID-19 and is part of the NIH Accelerating COVID-19 Treatment Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) public-private partnership. It is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial using Zyesami and the antiviral remdesivir (Veklury) both alone and in combination, to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients who are experiencing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Sarilumab: An interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist called sarilumab (marketed under the brand name Kevzara for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis) has been studied in critically ill COVID-19 patients who were in an intensive care unit (ICU). Results showed sarilumab improved patient outcomes including survival. The NIH COVID-19 treatment guidelines have sarilumab as an alternative if tofacitinib is not available, for treatment of hospitalized patients who require oxygen delivery through high-flow device or non invasive ventilation, or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Sotrovimab (Xevudy) is no longer authorized to treat COVID-19 in the United States from 5 April 2022. The authorization was canceled as it is unlikely to be effective against Omicron BA.2, the most common variant of COVID-19 at this time. It is a monoclonal antibody designed to block SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into healthy cells and clear infected cells. Statins: Statins (HMG CoA reductase inhibitors): The family of cholesterol lowering medications are studied to determine whether they can reduce severity of COVID-19. Statins are thought to have an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effect. Currently the recommendations for NIH is that if you are already taking a statin prescribed for your health condition, and then get COVID-19 you should continue taking your statin as prescribed. NIH does not recommend starting statins when you get COVID-19 if you have not been prescribed it for a health condition previously. STC3141: An investigational drug called STC3141 has been approved to commence phase II clinical research in Australia for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) suffered by COVID-19 patients. Umifenovir: An antiviral drug called umifenovir (marketed in Russia under the brand name Arbidol, and also available in China for the treatment of influenza) is being studied in China and other countries as a treatment for COVID-19.

Sometimes it can affect your outlook on life and make you feel that life isnÂ’t worth living. Depression may also be called major depressive disorder or clinical depression. What Causes Depression? Experts arenÂ’t exactly sure what causes depression but believe it is due to a combination of different factors, such as genetic vulnerability, faulty mood regulation by the brain, stress, chemicals in the brain, medications, or medical problems, that all interact together to bring on depression. The risk of developing depression is higher in women and people: Aged 45 to 64 years of age or the elderly With chronic or acute health conditions Who are undergoing a major life event, such as a job loss, divorce, workplace stress, or physical or mental abuse With severe grief due to the death of a loved one Taking prescription drugs that may cause a low mood Abusing alcohol or drugs. What are the Symptoms of Depression? Depression is not just feeling blue occasionally. It affects daily feelings, thoughts, and actions over a longer period. (MDD), can result in difficulties with family life, work, and social activities. Symptoms may vary depending on how severe a personÂ’s depression is but may include: A prolonged and persistent low mood, tearfulness, or a sense of hopelessness that has lasted for at least 2 weeks Irritability Anxiety Agitation or restlessness Avoidance or refusal to participate in activities that were previously enjoyed Withdrawal socially, from family, friends, and relationships Changes in sleeping or eating habits Unexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches Alcohol, drug, or substance abuse Engaging in risky or destructive behaviors Self-harm or attempts at suicide. In children and teens, symptoms may include clinginess, worry, aches and pain, and refusal to go to school. In older adults, symptoms may be less obvious and include memory difficulties or personality changes, physical aches and pains, and fatigue. How is Depression Diagnosed? If your mood has been low for a while and you are having difficulty coping with day to day activities, talk to your doctor or a trusted professional. Your doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms and your medical history and may ask you to complete a questionnaire that may help to diagnose depression or refer you to a psychiatrist. You can also call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-8255, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, or have an online chat (http://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/). All information is confidential and free. How is Depression Treated? Depression is treatable with high rates of success. Treatments may include: Psychotherapy Antidepressants, such as Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Responses to antidepressants vary, and most antidepressants take 4 to 6 weeks for full effect. About 50% of patients respond to the first treatment, whereas others may have to try a few different types of antidepressants before they find the best one for them. There are several things you can do to help with your symptoms as well, such as: Setting realistic and daily goals Developing strategies to work through crises situations Developing coping and problem-solving skills Learning how to develop positive relationships Replacing negative thoughts with positive ones."

However, it is either not enough to deal with all the glucose that is in their blood or their cells are unable to recognize the insulin and use it properly (this is called insulin resistance). Type 2 diabetes usually affects people who are middle-aged or older, and obesity is by far the biggest risk factor. In the past two decades, the condition has become more prevalent in younger people, including children, mainly because of the rising rates of obesity in children. People who do little exercise or of certain ethnicities (such as Native Americans, African-Americans, and Hispanics) are also at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Your doctor will also perform an examination and measure your blood pressure. Tests for cholesterol may also be conducted because approximately one-third of people with type 2 diabetes also have high blood pressure and high cholesterol as well. How is Type 2 Diabetes Treated? Even though symptoms of type 2 diabetes are barely noticeable in some people, constantly high blood sugar levels cause permanent damage to all the blood vessels and nerves in the body. Untreated diabetes can lead to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke, erectile dysfunction, foot problems, gum disease, eye and kidney disease, and many other problems. If treatment is not started early, it is too late to reverse any damage once symptoms become more noticeable.

High blood pressure is also called hypertension. Measuring somebody's blood pressure gives us an indication of how effectively their heart is working to pump blood around their body. If their heart and blood vessels are working efficiently, then their blood pressure will be normal or slightly below normal. If their heart is having to work very hard to pump blood around their body, then their blood pressure will be high. Blood pressure is composed of two measurements. The first recording is called the systolic pressure and it measures the force the heart must pump against to get blood to flow around the body. It can indicate how flexible or stiff the blood vessels are. During this measurement, the blood pressure cuff inflates to a certain extent and records what pressure around the arm stops blood flow. The second recording is called diastolic pressure. This measures the resting pressure when the heart relaxes between heartbeats. It is recorded while the blood pressure cuff is deflating. Most experts consider a normal blood pressure to be 120/80 mm Hg. Ideally, everybodyÂ’s blood pressure should be below 130/80 mm Hg. If the first number is above 130 or the second number is above 80 then a person is said to have high blood pressure. What are the symptoms of high blood pressure? Most people experience no symptoms when their blood pressure is high. Sometimes people may develop a headache or feel unwell; however, most do not connect these vague symptoms as having to do with their heart. If high blood pressure is left untreated, it can damage the blood vessels and increase a personÂ’s risk of having a stroke or a heart attack. It also causes the heart to enlarge and weaken because it essentially wears itself out from having to work so hard to push blood around the body. People with high blood pressure are also more likely to develop high cholesterol, kidney and eye problems, and have poor circulation in the legs and feet. How is High Blood Pressure Diagnosed? It is not uncommon for your blood pressure to go high occasionally; however, it is persistently high blood pressure that is a concern. For this reason, if a doctor or nurse takes your blood pressure and it is high but you donÂ’t have any risk factors or symptoms, then at least two other separate measurements should be taken before you are diagnosed with high blood pressure. Before getting your blood pressure taken you should avoid the following for at least an hour before the measurement: Strenuous exercise Smoking Caffeine Eating Stressful situations. Sit down for at least five minutes before the reading is taken and donÂ’t talk while it is being measured. Other tests may be ordered if your doctor concludes you have high blood pressure. These may include blood tests, an electrocardiogram, and sometimes a chest x-ray. How is High Blood Pressure Treated? Treatment depends on how high your blood pressure is. For people whose systolic reading falls in the range 120 to 129 and the diastolic reading is equal to or less than 80, lifestyle changes are usually recommended over medications. These may include: Losing weight if you are overweight Eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables Eating less salt Eating less saturated fats Increased physical activity More physical activity Limiting alcohol. If treatment is considered necessary, sometimes more than one medication is prescribed. high blood pressure include: Diuretics Beta-blockers ACE inhibitors Angiotensin-receptor blockers Calcium channel blockers Alpha-blockers."

High blood pressure is also called hypertension. Measuring somebody's blood pressure gives us an indication of how effectively their heart is working to pump blood around their body. If their heart and blood vessels are working efficiently, then their blood pressure will be normal or slightly below normal. If their heart is having to work very hard to pump blood around their body, then their blood pressure will be high. Blood pressure is composed of two measurements. The first recording is called the systolic pressure and it measures the force the heart must pump against to get blood to flow around the body. It can indicate how flexible or stiff the blood vessels are. During this measurement, the blood pressure cuff inflates to a certain extent and records what pressure around the arm stops blood flow. The second recording is called diastolic pressure. This measures the resting pressure when the heart relaxes between heartbeats. It is recorded while the blood pressure cuff is deflating. Most experts consider a normal blood pressure to be 120/80 mm Hg. Ideally, everybodyÂ’s blood pressure should be below 130/80 mm Hg. If the first number is above 130 or the second number is above 80 then a person is said to have high blood pressure. What are the symptoms of high blood pressure? Most people experience no symptoms when their blood pressure is high.

Before getting your blood pressure taken you should avoid the following for at least an hour before the measurement: Strenuous exercise Smoking Caffeine Eating Stressful situations. Sit down for at least five minutes before the reading is taken and donÂ’t talk while it is being measured. Other tests may be ordered if your doctor concludes you have high blood pressure. These may include blood tests, an electrocardiogram, and sometimes a chest x-ray. How is High Blood Pressure Treated? Treatment depends on how high your blood pressure is. For people whose systolic reading falls in the range 120 to 129 and the diastolic reading is equal to or less than 80, lifestyle changes are usually recommended over medications. These may include: Losing weight if you are overweight Eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables Eating less salt Eating less saturated fats Increased physical activity More physical activity Limiting alcohol.

High blood pressure is also called hypertension. Measuring somebody's blood pressure gives us an indication of how effectively their heart is working to pump blood around their body. If their heart and blood vessels are working efficiently, then their blood pressure will be normal or slightly below normal. If their heart is having to work very hard to pump blood around their body, then their blood pressure will be high. Blood pressure is composed of two measurements. The first recording is called the systolic pressure and it measures the force the heart must pump against to get blood to flow around the body. It can indicate how flexible or stiff the blood vessels are. During this measurement, the blood pressure cuff inflates to a certain extent and records what pressure around the arm stops blood flow. The second recording is called diastolic pressure. This measures the resting pressure when the heart relaxes between heartbeats. It is recorded while the blood pressure cuff is deflating. Most experts consider a normal blood pressure to be 120/80 mm Hg. Ideally, everybodyÂ’s blood pressure should be below 130/80 mm Hg. If the first number is above 130 or the second number is above 80 then a person is said to have high blood pressure. What are the symptoms of high blood pressure? Most people experience no symptoms when their blood pressure is high. Sometimes people may develop a headache or feel unwell; however, most do not connect these vague symptoms as having to do with their heart. If high blood pressure is left untreated, it can damage the blood vessels and increase a personÂ’s risk of having a stroke or a heart attack.

Before getting your blood pressure taken you should avoid the following for at least an hour before the measurement: Strenuous exercise Smoking Caffeine Eating Stressful situations. Sit down for at least five minutes before the reading is taken and donÂ’t talk while it is being measured. Other tests may be ordered if your doctor concludes you have high blood pressure. These may include blood tests, an electrocardiogram, and sometimes a chest x-ray. How is High Blood Pressure Treated? Treatment depends on how high your blood pressure is. For people whose systolic reading falls in the range 120 to 129 and the diastolic reading is equal to or less than 80, lifestyle changes are usually recommended over medications.

High blood pressure is also called hypertension. Measuring somebody's blood pressure gives us an indication of how effectively their heart is working to pump blood around their body. If their heart and blood vessels are working efficiently, then their blood pressure will be normal or slightly below normal. If their heart is having to work very hard to pump blood around their body, then their blood pressure will be high. Blood pressure is composed of two measurements. The first recording is called the systolic pressure and it measures the force the heart must pump against to get blood to flow around the body. It can indicate how flexible or stiff the blood vessels are. During this measurement, the blood pressure cuff inflates to a certain extent and records what pressure around the arm stops blood flow. The second recording is called diastolic pressure. This measures the resting pressure when the heart relaxes between heartbeats. It is recorded while the blood pressure cuff is deflating. Most experts consider a normal blood pressure to be 120/80 mm Hg. Ideally, everybodyÂ’s blood pressure should be below 130/80 mm Hg. If the first number is above 130 or the second number is above 80 then a person is said to have high blood pressure. What are the symptoms of high blood pressure? Most people experience no symptoms when their blood pressure is high. Sometimes people may develop a headache or feel unwell; however, most do not connect these vague symptoms as having to do with their heart. If high blood pressure is left untreated, it can damage the blood vessels and increase a personÂ’s risk of having a stroke or a heart attack. It also causes the heart to enlarge and weaken because it essentially wears itself out from having to work so hard to push blood around the body. People with high blood pressure are also more likely to develop high cholesterol, kidney and eye problems, and have poor circulation in the legs and feet. How is High Blood Pressure Diagnosed?

High blood pressure is also called hypertension. Measuring somebody's blood pressure gives us an indication of how effectively their heart is working to pump blood around their body. If their heart and blood vessels are working efficiently, then their blood pressure will be normal or slightly below normal. If their heart is having to work very hard to pump blood around their body, then their blood pressure will be high. Blood pressure is composed of two measurements. The first recording is called the systolic pressure and it measures the force the heart must pump against to get blood to flow around the body. It can indicate how flexible or stiff the blood vessels are. During this measurement, the blood pressure cuff inflates to a certain extent and records what pressure around the arm stops blood flow. The second recording is called diastolic pressure. This measures the resting pressure when the heart relaxes between heartbeats. It is recorded while the blood pressure cuff is deflating. Most experts consider a normal blood pressure to be 120/80 mm Hg. Ideally, everybodyÂ’s blood pressure should be below 130/80 mm Hg. If the first number is above 130 or the second number is above 80 then a person is said to have high blood pressure. What are the symptoms of high blood pressure? Most people experience no symptoms when their blood pressure is high. Sometimes people may develop a headache or feel unwell; however, most do not connect these vague symptoms as having to do with their heart. If high blood pressure is left untreated, it can damage the blood vessels and increase a personÂ’s risk of having a stroke or a heart attack. It also causes the heart to enlarge and weaken because it essentially wears itself out from having to work so hard to push blood around the body. People with high blood pressure are also more likely to develop high cholesterol, kidney and eye problems, and have poor circulation in the legs and feet. How is High Blood Pressure Diagnosed?

This can range from an occasional leakage of urine, to a complete inability to hold any urine. The three main types of urinary incontinence are: Stress incontinence -- occurs during certain activities like coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercise. Stress incontinence is a bladder storage problem in which the strength of the muscles (urethral sphincter) that help control urination is reduced. The sphincter is not able to prevent urine flow when there is increased pressure from the abdomen. Stress incontinence may occur as a result of weakened pelvic muscles that support the bladder and urethra or because of a malfunction of the urethral sphincter. Treatment for stress incontinence may include behavioral changes, medication, pelvic floor muscle training or surgery.

It is mostly due to the breakdown of cartilage in the joints. Cartilage is a firm, rubbery material that covers the end of each bone. It provides a smooth gliding surface for joint motion and acts as a cushion between bones. Without cartilage, friction between bones can occur and there is a loss of the shock-absorbing capability of the joint. Inflammatory processes increase which further damages the cartilage and more pressure is placed directly onto the bones in a joint. Pressure can cause the growth of bone spurs and bits of bone or cartilage may chip off and float around the joint. Obesity, injuries, and weak muscles can also contribute to osteoarthritis and it is more common in certain families. Osteoarthritis most commonly occurs in the hands, knees, hips and spine. What are the Symptoms of Osteoarthritis? Symptoms vary depending on how many joints are affected and how severely they are affected. Symptoms also tend to build up gradually over time rather than come on suddenly and include: Pain and stiffness in the affected joints, particularly first thing in the morning or after inactivity. This tends to resolve within about 30 minutes of gentle movement Limited range of movement in a joint Affected joints may swell after extended activity Clicking or a cracking sound when a joint bends Pain may also increase after activity or towards the end of the day. Symptoms can differ depending on which joint is affected. Knee joints: moving the knee causes a grating or scraping sensation Hip joints: Pain may radiate down the inside of the knee or thigh or be felt in the groin or buttock area Fingers: Bony growths (spurs) may occur inside the joint causing the joints to become swollen, tender and red Inflammatory arthritis of the hand: All day stiffness may be noticed early in the disease Feet: Swelling and pain may be felt at the base of the big toe or around the ankles. How is Osteoarthritis Diagnosed? Your doctor will perform a physical examination and ask you about your history of symptoms and whether you have any family members with the condition. Other tests may include: Blood tests to look for inflammatory markers Joint aspiration to look for evidence of joint deterioration or crystals X-ray of the joint to look for bone changes MRI to provide a better image of cartilage changes. Morning stiffness helps to differentiate osteoarthritis from rheumatoid arthritis. With rheumatoid arthritis, joint stiffness may not improve for several hours or it may last throughout the entire day. How is Osteoarthritis Treated? Treatment for osteoarthritis includes lifestyle changes and medications. All patients with osteoarthritis should be enrolled in an exercise program because physical activity increases blood flow, and joints and muscles are supplied with more oxygen. Swimming, Tai Chi and weight-based exercises are usually suitable for people with osteoarthritis, although a physician should be consulted before starting any exercise program. Weight loss can lower the risk of pain in weight-bearing joints and orthotics, devices that help to align joints - orthotic shoe inserts, splints, and braces can help with movement.

It provides a smooth gliding surface for joint motion and acts as a cushion between bones. Without cartilage, friction between bones can occur and there is a loss of the shock-absorbing capability of the joint. Inflammatory processes increase which further damages the cartilage and more pressure is placed directly onto the bones in a joint. Pressure can cause the growth of bone spurs and bits of bone or cartilage may chip off and float around the joint. Obesity, injuries, and weak muscles can also contribute to osteoarthritis and it is more common in certain families. Osteoarthritis most commonly occurs in the hands, knees, hips and spine. What are the Symptoms of Osteoarthritis? Symptoms vary depending on how many joints are affected and how severely they are affected. Symptoms also tend to build up gradually over time rather than come on suddenly and include: Pain and stiffness in the affected joints, particularly first thing in the morning or after inactivity. This tends to resolve within about 30 minutes of gentle movement Limited range of movement in a joint Affected joints may swell after extended activity Clicking or a cracking sound when a joint bends Pain may also increase after activity or towards the end of the day. Symptoms can differ depending on which joint is affected. Knee joints: moving the knee causes a grating or scraping sensation Hip joints: Pain may radiate down the inside of the knee or thigh or be felt in the groin or buttock area Fingers: Bony growths (spurs) may occur inside the joint causing the joints to become swollen, tender and red Inflammatory arthritis of the hand: All day stiffness may be noticed early in the disease Feet: Swelling and pain may be felt at the base of the big toe or around the ankles. How is Osteoarthritis Diagnosed? Your doctor will perform a physical examination and ask you about your history of symptoms and whether you have any family members with the condition. Other tests may include: Blood tests to look for inflammatory markers Joint aspiration to look for evidence of joint deterioration or crystals X-ray of the joint to look for bone changes MRI to provide a better image of cartilage changes. Morning stiffness helps to differentiate osteoarthritis from rheumatoid arthritis. With rheumatoid arthritis, joint stiffness may not improve for several hours or it may last throughout the entire day. How is Osteoarthritis Treated? Treatment for osteoarthritis includes lifestyle changes and medications. All patients with osteoarthritis should be enrolled in an exercise program because physical activity increases blood flow, and joints and muscles are supplied with more oxygen. Swimming, Tai Chi and weight-based exercises are usually suitable for people with osteoarthritis, although a physician should be consulted before starting any exercise program. Weight loss can lower the risk of pain in weight-bearing joints and orthotics, devices that help to align joints - orthotic shoe inserts, splints, and braces can help with movement.

It is mostly due to the breakdown of cartilage in the joints. Cartilage is a firm, rubbery material that covers the end of each bone. It provides a smooth gliding surface for joint motion and acts as a cushion between bones. Without cartilage, friction between bones can occur and there is a loss of the shock-absorbing capability of the joint.

Older males are also at a higher risk. Other factors that increase the risk of a UTI include: Sexual intercourse Certain contraceptives (eg, diaphragms or spermicides) Wiping from back to front after a bowel movement The presence of kidney or bladder stones Urinating without fully emptying the bladder Pregnancy Having a urinary catheter. UTIs in children are reasonably common, affecting up to 8% of girls and 2% of boys. Young children also have a higher risk of kidney damage from UTIs than adults. Some children are born with vesicoureteral reflux, where urine reenters the bladder from one or both ureters, which also increases the likelihood of UTIs. A bladder infection is a type of urinary tract infection, but not all UTIs are bladder infections. Bladder infections are the most common type of UTIs. A bladder infection may also be called cystitis and it is usually caused by bacteria. What are the Symptoms of a UTI Symptoms of a UTI can differ depending on what part of the urinary tract is infected. A bladder infection usually causes symptoms that include the following: Burning when urinating (the medical term for this is dysuria) The feeling that you need to pee frequently, but when you go to the toilet very little urine comes out Pain in the pelvic area just above the pubic bone. Bladder infections are usually considered a Â“simple UTIÂ” and treatment is usually with antibiotics (such as trimethoprim or amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium) for three to five days. Symptoms usually resolve in a couple of days. People with an infection of the urethra (called urethritis) may experience symptoms similar to a bladder infection in addition to itching or irritation at the end of the urethra where the pee comes out. Symptoms of a kidney infection are usually more widespread and more severe than those of a bladder infection and may include: Fever or chills Cloudy or foul-smelling urine Pink or red-tinged urine (this is a sign of bleeding in the urinary tract) Burning when urinating The feeling that you need to pee frequently, but when you go to the toilet very little urine comes out Pain in the pelvic area just above the pubic bone Moderate to severe lower back pain Nausea or vomiting. Kidney infections are considered the worse type of UTI and usually start as a bladder or urethra infection but then the bacteria multiply and travel up to the kidneys. Kidney infections are usually called complicated UTIs and some people may require hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics. Less severe infections may be treated with oral antibiotics over a week or more. Untreated kidney infections can be life-threatening. Preventing UTIs There is controversy over whether unsweetened cranberry juice is an effective treatment or prevention for UTIs. A 2013 review of 24 studies concluded that is was less effective than previously thought. The risk of UTIs may be lessened by staying hydrated and urinating when the need arises, not holding it in. Women should wipe from front to back after a bowel movement, urinate before and after sex, and avoiding using douches, vaginal sprays, and scented feminine hygiene products. They should avoid wearing restrictive, synthetic clothing, or change out of such clothing as soon as possible after exercising or swimming."
