*** Attention: This project utilizes python scripts, many of which were created in Jupyter notebook. While a lot of the coding was done in VS code and can be operated from there, we strongly recommend that users download Jupyter notebook to operate ipynb files.

*** Attention: access keys are required to operate this project, please contact one of the team members for the config.py file.

To activate the app.py file:

First, the user should open Gitbash and switch to the environment where they wish to clone the repository.
Then, go to the project's repository on Github, select "Code" and copy the link from the repository. 
After that, go back to Gitbash type "git clone" and then paste the URL of the GitHub repository. 
Next, drag the project folder to VS code and once it is there, navigate to the top left corner of VS code.

After that, the user should right-click the link labeled "Predict", now the user can choose one file to upload from our local_drug_directory file. 
To find this file please refer to this guide: Pill-Identifier>flask_model>models>local_drug_directory.
Now the user can open any of the pill files listed and choose any of the images provided.
Once the name of the file appears next to the "Choose files" icon on the Predict page please right-click "Submit". 
The user will then receive an alert with instructions stating "Hit Recognize for results!". 
Then the user should right-click the "OK" button on the alert message.
Please allow 1 to 2 seconds to pass before right-clicking "Submit", this allows  the image to be uploaded into the "upload" folder.
