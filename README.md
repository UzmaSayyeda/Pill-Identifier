## Pill Image recognition with Machine Learning


## Introduction

The primary goal of this project is to utilize machine learning to analyze and identify pill images based off image files submitted by a user to our web application. To achieve this objective, we have developed a web application that integrates an optimized machine learning model. This application is designed for use by people in the medical profession as well as anyone who has to take medications regularly to help identify medications.

## Why?

- Medication Identification:
  - Patient Safety: Pill recognition models can help patients verify and ensure they are taking the correct medication prescribed to them, reducing the risk of medication errors.
  - Healthcare Professionals: Healthcare providers can use pill recognition for medication administration, particularly in busy hospital settings where multiple medications may be administered.

- Preventing Medication Errors:
  - Pill recognition can help prevent medication errors in healthcare settings, where different medications may have similar appearances. This is crucial for patient safety and adherence to treatment plans.

- Telehealth and Remote Patient Monitoring:
  - In telehealth scenarios, where patients are remotely monitored, pill recognition can assist healthcare professionals in tracking medication adherence and ensuring patients are following prescribed treatment plans.

- Educational Tools:
  - Pill recognition models can be integrated into educational tools for healthcare professionals, pharmacists, and patients to enhance their understanding of medications and improve medication management practices.

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

- The image files were downloaded from our S3 bucket into our local environment
where they were organized into 23 seperate classifications.
- The images were then displayed an inspected to make sure they were in the proper format.
- They were then preprocessed and all resized to 224,224 to ensure consistency before being passed into the model.

### Data Preprocessing 
* [Jupyter Notebook code for Data Preprocessing](<split_data_mobilenet.ipynb>)


#### Notes on the Data Cleaning/Preprocessing Process
* For this model we utilized an S3 bucket for data storage. 
* We downloaded the image files from the bucket and selected which consisted of 552 files
* In Pyton using the splitfolders function we then split that into a training dataset and a validation dataset
at a ratio=(.8, 0.1,0.1)
* We preproccessed and scaled the images to 224/224
* The training directory used 437 images belonging to 23 classes
* The validation directory used 46 images belonging to 23 classes

**Building the Machine Learning**
We tried a few different machine learning models to figure out the best accuracy for our end goal. 

### Machine Learning Models:

| Model | Accuracy|
|-----:|---------------|
| VGG16 |   83%  |
| RestNet50 |  8%  |
| EfficientNetV2B0 |  4%  |
| DenseNet121 |  100%  |
| MobileNet       | 100%      |

- **Training Dataset:**
  - Dataset Size: 437 pill images.
  - Features: Each row in the dataset represents an image, with each pixel of the image treated as a feature.
  - Target Variable: The "Target" column indicates the class label, where 0 represents uninfected cells, and 1 represents infected cells.

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Image Resizing: All images were resized to a consistent size  to ensure uniform input dimensions for the CNN.
  

- **Model Architecture:**

  - The same Model Architecture was used for each model.

    - Base Model Integration:
      The architecture starts with a pre-existing neural network model referred to as the "base model.
    - Sequential Model Construction:
      - For each tuple (name, base_model) in the base_models list:
       -  A new Sequential model is created.
          The base model is added as the first layer of the Sequential model.
    - Layers Added to Sequential Model:
        - Following the base model, the Sequential model has the following  layers added:
          - Global Average Pooling 2D layer: This layer reduces the spatial dimensions of the data to a single value per feature map using global average pooling.
          - Dense layer with 23 units and softmax activation: This layer is the output layer with 23 units, indicating a multi-class classification task with 23 classes. The softmax activation is commonly used for multi-class classification.
    - Model Compilation:
        - The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer, categorical crossentropy loss function (suitable for multi-class classification problems), and accuracy as the metric for evaluation.
    - Model Training:
        - The model is trained on a training data generator (train_generator) for 2 epochs.
    - Model Evaluation:
        - After training, the model is evaluated using a validation data generator (validation_generator), and the loss and accuracy are computed.
    - DataFrame Creation:
        - The results, including the model name, accuracy, and loss, are stored in lists (names, accuracy, and loss), and a pandas DataFrame (df) is created from these lists.

- **Model Training:**
  - Loss Function: Categorical-Crossentropy.
  - Optimizer: Adam
  - Epochs: 2
  - Batch Size: 1
  - Validation Split: 20% of the training data was used for validation during training to monitor model performance.

- **Model Summary:**
    - Model architecture with detailed layer information for top model.
    - Total parameters: 14,726,847 (56.18 MB)
    - Trainable parameters: 11,799 (46.09 KB)
    - Non-trainable parameters: 14,714,688 (56.13 MB)

## FLASK
### Key Libraries Used:

| Type | Library|
|-----:|---------------|
| Data Handling & Processing|   Numpy, Pandas |
| Web Framework |  Flask  |
| Storage & AWS Interaction|  Boto3, S3   |
| Randomization| Random  |
|  Database & ORM| SQLite, csv  |

### Backend Processes & AWS Integration:
* To interact with our AWS storage, we generated pre-signed URLs from our S3 bucket name and key. This provides an API for Flask to retrieve image files.
 * This is publicly available data so we made the S3 bucket public as well as we were not concerned with security for this application.
### User Interaction & Data Handling:
* Flask plays a pivotal role in capturing user input data from our web game, which is temporarily stored in a global variable.

### API Creation:
* Using Flask, we've set up API routes that output data in JSON format.
  
**These intricacies, woven together, create a robust and interactive platform tailored to our users' needs.**

* To run Flask: [app.py](<flask-model/app.py>)
* SQLite Database: [pill_predictions.db](<flask-model/pill_predictions.db>)
* SQL Database Generation: [sqlite.ipynb](<flask-model/sqlite.ipynb>)


### Front-end: 
* HTML and CSS have been employed to design the visuals and effects.
### Visualization: 
* Matplotlib was used to generate accuracy and loss visuals
### Backend & Storage:
* With Flask serving as our backend framework, we're efficiently reading data from our database.
* AWS S3 has been our choice for storage. It allows us to select image names from the database and subsequently extract and display the relevant image files on the website.
### User Interaction: 

* By seamlessly integrating these tools, we've been able to craft a dynamic and interactive platform for our users.**
